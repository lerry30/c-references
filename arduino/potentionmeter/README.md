### Control LED Brightness Using Potentiometer

Here's a simple circuit and program in AVR Arduino in C programming
that allows analog input from potentiometer converted to digital(ADC)
value. The value will control the brightness of LED by twisting potentiometer
clock wise or counter clock wise to increase and decrease its brightness.
